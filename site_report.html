        Learning CSS basics has been quite the journey, filled with moments of both frustration and triumph. While I encountered a few hurdles along the way, one particular obstacle that stands out is getting the hamburger menu to function smoothly on devices. However, after some persistence and problem-solving, I managed to figure it out in the end. This whole experience has been incredibly fulfilling.

        Each issue I encountered served as a learning opportunity that contributed to my growth as both a designer and a problem solver. My venture into creating an HTML portfolio has truly been an adventure. Beginning with setting up the structure involving HTML declarations, meta tags, and linking to my CSS file for styling purposes, I soon found myself grappling with challenges related to designing navigation buttons that not only worked seamlessly but also looked aesthetically pleasing, proving to be more daunting than initially anticipated.

        Nevertheless, I persevered through these obstacles by organizing the page layout with elements such as a container div, navigation sidebar, and primary content section. Keeping things uncomplicated yet effective, I incorporated navigation links leading to sections within my portfolio including the homepage, project showcase page, video demonstrations section, and contact page. Despite encountering obstacles along the way, I take pride in what I have accomplished.
